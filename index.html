                <h3>Jen Fong-Adwent</h3>
                <p>RVLVVR (pronounced revolver) is a distributed messaging experiment using keybase.io as a base for user management. There are many complications with how the distributed messaging model works, along with how public key operates that do not enable ease of use for the general public. How do we build communication systems to allow for these pieces to work better? Or is this the wrong model?</p>
                <h3>Noah Swartz</h3>
                <p>Many developers want to create the best user experience they can. But this means more than making a slick UI or building extra features. As members of the tech community we are in a unique position to understand and affect the the technology that has a major impact on the lives of everyone who uses the internet. This talk will give developers tools to empower them to build user protections into their apps, their companies, and our legal system so we can all truly 'Fight for the User'.</p>
                <h3>Ruth Baril</h3>
                <p>Starting down the road as a developer is like being Alice falling into Wonderland. This new world is full of amazing and wonderful things, but is also confusing, scary, and without a clear path. I am going to talk about my own journey into Wonderland, and the feelings and challenges from this time that you might have forgotten.</p>
