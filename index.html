                <h3>Jen Fong-Adwent</h3>
                <p>RVLVVR (pronounced revolver) is a distributed messaging experiment using keybase.io as a base for user management. There are many complications with how the distributed messaging model works, along with how public key operates that do not enable ease of use for the general public. How do we build communication systems to allow for these pieces to work better? Or is this the wrong model?</p>
                <h3>Ruth Baril</h3>
                <p>Starting down the road as a developer is like being Alice falling into Wonderland. This new world is full of amazing and wonderful things, but is also confusing, scary, and without a clear path. I am going to talk about my own journey into Wonderland, and the feelings and challenges from this time that you might have forgotten.</p>
