                <h3>Format &amp; Audience</h3>
                <p>Talks are 20 minutes. There is no time for Q&A after. JSFest is designed to be accessible. Talks should be targetted at new to intermediate skill levels.</p>
                <h3>What makes a good talk</h3>
                <p>Don't talk about a technology, tell the story of what you did with that technology.</p>
                <p>Nobody ever left a conference talk with enough information in their head to write a program from what they learned. For obvious practical reasons people learn and continue to follow documentation while writing software. Don't try to teach people what is already in the documentation, tell them a story that makes them care enough to follow up with that technology.</p>
                <h3>Is there a theme for JSBBQ talks?</h3>
                <p><b>No!</b> While other JSFest events have themes, JSBBQ does not. We want to hear what you love about JavaScript...while we eat tasty BBQ'd foods.</p>
